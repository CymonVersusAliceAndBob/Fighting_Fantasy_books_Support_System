/**
This is for folks who are new to HTML5. 

The following questions are for you to check your understanding. Please be aware that some of the techniques I introduce in this web application are contrary to ways you might know from HTML4.01. Still they are not at all my own idea but instead I apply best practices accourding to the W3C as best as I can. (For more on topic you might want to visit one of the HTML5 courses at edx(dot)org offered by the W3C. If you stumble upon something where this seems to be the case, please be aware that one of the most important differences between 5 and 4.01 is the sementic web, a concept that is very important e.g. for SEO. Alas the result is not visible within seconds but rathermore within weeks.

There are also some techniques that are not related to the W3C but rather more to DevOps. If you're just about to start developing, lets just say this has got to do with large webbased applications developed by teams that need to publish tiny updates asap.

So here's your questions:

What's the purpose of the alt-attribute and what's the topic called for which it is important?
What is a microservice?
What is a MIME type and where is it needed on this page?
What is so great about the way that the object element is used here?
