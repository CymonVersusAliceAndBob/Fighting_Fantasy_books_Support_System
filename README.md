# Fighting_Fantasy_books_Support_System v0.0
This web based application will support authors of Fighting Fantasy books (short: FFBs). FFbs are a branch of the genre Role Playing Games that can be played by single players. In the most basic form FFb's consist of sections of usually no more than twenty sentences. At the end of each the player is offered a few choices of where to go on. E.g. You arrive at a crossroads: Turn left: Section 23, Turn right: Section 187, Straight on: Section 38, Back to whence you came: Section 92.

So how will this application support you as an author?

## Testing your work
Usually FFBs are tested by readers that take the volume "as is" and will chose sections as they prefer. Thus it is most probable that there will be paths that haven't been checked by test players. So the FFbSS will include a generator that choses paths and comes up with a unique story for each of the testers. So for them it is like reading a regular book. Thus you can be more certain about whether or not your FFB is consistently written no matter what your players decide to do.

## Probability chart generator
The FFbSS will generate a probability for the death/survival of a players character depending on the chosen path. Thus you will be able to refine the rules or difficulty of certain enemies in certain section.

## Character Sheet generator
Most FFBs work with some kind of character sheet that determines the abilities of the played character. So to support you in determining a suiting bundle of abilities you will be able to choose from a broad range of abilities, properties, attributes and so on. But you will also be able to enter new abilities, properties, attributes and so on.

## Statistics on the usage of abilities
For players one of the most annoying things ist a bundle of abilities they carefully chose in the beginning that are hardly ever used. So with this feature you will be able to keep track of how often a certain ability can be used throughout the game.

## Distance, Time and Speed
Most FFBs take place in some kind of landscape. Thus it is a good idea to ensure that the time for traveling is consistent if the player takes alternative paths to a certain point of interest. Thus you can define places and areas in that landscape plus the difficulty to travel from one place to the next. Based upon this a simple map will be created that you could hand over to your artist to create a nice map that shows the games world as it actually is.
